                    Hello cusatians, <br><br><br>

                    I am Rahmathullah m, pursuing final year BBA LLB from sls, cusat. I am contesting for the post of senate member in the university academic council and senate elections scheduled to be held on Feb 5 under the banner of Kerala students union.<br><br>
                    
                     We believe that we deserve much more than the false hope given to us from time to time . We believe that there are so many things to change around us. We believe that We deserve better!<br><br>
                    
                    In the past 4 years, we were able to  persuade the authorities to recognise and enforce several rights of student community like s4 s6 special supplimentary, sanitary napkin vending machines in the campus and much more. <br><br>
                    
                    We don't believe in violence or in a revolution that can only spring up from blood. We have never failed to protest, we have  never made a compromise to fight an injustice and that is what we are.<br><br>
                    
                    All it takes, to make the change is your vote and if you vote, it's not about me winning the election, but we wanting change.<br>
            </p>
